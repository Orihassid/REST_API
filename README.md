# REST_API
created an API server with node.js 

I created an API for a social network with express.
There is a user who is the admin. He can authorize other users to log in to the social network. In addition each user can send a message to another user. The admin can also send a message to all users. The admin may delete or suspend users. It can also delete user posts. Anyone who wants to connect to the network should put a username and password and in each login the user gets a token with which he can do the rest of the operations on the network.
